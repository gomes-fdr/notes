I have been work along this year with Qt framework and there are a lot of things that I really liked, here we going in another list of things that make Qt a great C++ framework to work.

## What is it?
Well Qt is a super set of C++ it yours main goal is provide a GUI cross platform kit. I think this was the primary idea of the creators of Qt, today I prefer to believe that it is a whole tool to create solutions for a multi environments, since desktops apps, services and CLI tools in a vast different kinds of OSs.

## Documentation
We have a lot of good strategies designs in Qt, but the documentations is one the strongest thing in this project. Using your code's editor or through the web, we always have full access to complete information, rich of examples e well written explanations.

## Great standard library
Qt isn't a new program language, even so it provide a great collection of facilities to turn C++ more pleasure, take a look this list:

* Modules
  * Qt Core
  * Qt GUI
  * Qt Widgets
  * Qt QML
  * Qt Quick
  * Qt Networks
  * Qt Multimedia
  * Qt SQL
  * Qt Webengine
  * Qt Test
  
And there are a lot of addons, that compose a full collection of solutions that make the developer life more easy.

## Integration with C++ standard library
C++ has been in evolution in the last decades and Qt always try to use what the original language have provide, some examples:

* Use of auto pointers and the replace of foreach as a MACRO.
* Replacement the qmake build system for cmake - this is new in Qt6.
* Support to lambda functions, direct inheritance from C++.

I know that this list is much bigger, but that are things that impact me in the first time that I saw those.

## IDE Integrated development environment
Qt has a tool to write code, it is qt-creator and it is a very good tool, has auto-complete, git integration, GUI builder, debugger and much more things.

I used to use qt-creator to code in C, because of your excellent workflow a robustness.

## Companies that use Qt
So, all this things and a lot of that I even don't know, make the adoption of Qt almost a natural choice to develop robust apps, that is the reason why some companies adopt it:

* AMD
* Blizzard Entertainment
* BMW
* European Space Agency
* Dreamworks
* GE
* Huawei
* John Deere
* LG
* LucasFilm
* Microsoft
* Panasonic
* Phillips
* Bosh
* Samsung
* Siemens
* Tesla
* Volvo
* HP
* Valve

This is a list of companies that I knew - for sure it is much bigger than that!

So, if you are thinking in a tech to learn and like the C family way. It is a great option to be considering with.

There are a lot of companies to work with and a great collection of opensource project to colaborate.
