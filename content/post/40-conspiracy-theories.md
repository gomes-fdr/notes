I simply love scify stories, and in the last year I have watched a lot of then. But what has taken my attention was the number of conspiracy theories that born or came back with a very powerfull force.

So I decided to make a list of it, let's see then.

## 1. Ancient astronauts

When I was young, I readed a book, it is name was [Chariots of the Gods? Unsolved Mysteries of the Past](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chariots_of_the_Gods%3F) by _Erich Anton Paul von DÃ¤niken_. I confess that my head exploded, because it was a great idea, the gods come from space and we are a product made by its hands, very powerful idea.

## 2. Reptilian

They say that it is a very old, but I heard about that recently. In this theory, the most important persons that rule the world was replaced by alien creatures that under the human skin are lizards(or things like that).

## 3. Invisible hand

That is a sofisticated sample, because it mixed with historical facts. In a breaf, we have a very powerfull _kings_ that rule the globe, until I know this is tottally truth, but the trick - what bring some misteriou is that _people_ are living in the shadowns and no one knows they.

## 4. Time travellers

The title talks! We have people that come from future and they do things, I don't know if are good or not.

## 5. Medicine [x] cause disease [y]

And finally, we have the idea that some big pharma that rule the market of medicine(even whole countries) - create some medicine that kill or mutilate us.

## What I think...

1. I like the idea of aliens, really do - and I have afraid to get by them, but I don't think that they really care about us.
2. Same to item 1 - the lizards don't want to eat us - by the way I love [Morena Baccarin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morena_Baccarin).
3. This is happen all the time, since we were living in top of the trees - but human beings are very vain to stay in the shadows, trust me.
4. It will be wonderful if in some point of time we discover that, congrats for us.
5. That is it very ugly thing to think about us. The time travelers will not allow that its happened. unless the reptilians are in the way.

We have a lot of things to learn and ideas like that five listed above, stopped being funny a long time ago.

Be safe.
