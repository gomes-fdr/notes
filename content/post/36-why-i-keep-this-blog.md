I decided to start this web log for my own sake, In different times I forget very important things. Things that I already did and just forget, normally I take some notes in paper or in text file.

Recently a read a post from [Andr√© Noel](https://www.uol.com.br/tilt/colunas/andre-noel/2021/01/30/sua-memoria-esta-te-traindo-nao-confie-so-nela-ou-perdera-oportunidades.htm) - it is in Portuguese, reflect exactly what I was thinking in this weekend.

## Responsibilities versus Obligations
Sometimes I have no idea of what to write, mainly in English. When I thought about this blog, I was thinking mainly in tech stuff. Well we have some, but I think it is very important to record any idea that I could use in future, or could be useful for anyone.

This is the core of Noel's post and this is why I decide to create this place, sometimes is good to read content like this to remember the whys of things.
