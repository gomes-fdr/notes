I am a huge fan of Python, I remember that I meet Python in 2003, I guess - In those time I've never worked as a software developer, I really wanted , but it isn't this that did put food on my table.

Time goes on and did I lot of things, worked with python in 2018 - developing a system like a self employee - unfortly this is could not be finished. But in the last month I started a new adventure, work in a [company](https://www.azion.com/en/) that use a lot of Python.

I hope that I can share and learning very much - The environment is very propitious and foment continuous improvements.

So, my next notes will be about Python and it is whole characteristics.

Enjoy.
