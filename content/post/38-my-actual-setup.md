Yes another post about my setup.

## Debian as base system
The universal operating system, netinstall with minimal number of package.

## KDE
I started use Qt apps in the last year and I like the experience a lot, so I decied to give a try with KDE, and it surprise me.

## Minimal install
I don't like the standard install made by the Debian installer, so I did this way:

	sudo apt -y install kde-plasma-desktop plasma-nm
	sudo reboot

That is it! Of course if you want more things you can add anytime, for example:

	sudo apt -y install ark kcalc kde-spectacle okular
