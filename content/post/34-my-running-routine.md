I've started to run in september 11 2020, this is the way that I found to temporarily replace jiu-jitsu. I confess that in the beginning was very hard, because your body try to make you give up, exacly as jiu-jutsu did.

I guess this is the reason that made I did not get out or give up - I started in jiu-jutsu in 2013, I was 39. Like now was terrible, the body hurts, the mind complain and what move your on is your spirit(I am atheist, but you known what I mean).

The first mounth I interpolate between short runnings and walkings, in total, I was doing 5km every other day. The second mounth came, I kept that pace, increasing the runs and decreasing the walks.

Today we are in november, I start walk 1km, run 3km and walk 1km again. My goal is to run 5km without stop, I guess that in one or two mounths I will get that!

When  jiu-jutsu come back, I will mantain the runnings - it is so challenger even like martial arts.

It's just you and your steps, straight ahead.
